# `person.move_to` action with `path` with not enough movement

## Given
- 1 `person`
- 1 `location_graph` with 3 `node` linked from
    - `node_id` to `node_id_2`
        - with `person_progress_property` to 4
        - with `total_progress` to 1
- 1 `actions` with `person.move_to` having `path` including only `node_id_destination`
## Then
It should move person_id to node_id_2 because it doesn't have a link to `node_id_destination`
